# Kaki Detection Script

This script processes an image to detect and estimate the number of kakis (persimmons) by identifying the common orange areas using a Gaussian fit method with least squares estimation.

## Overview

The script performs the following steps:
- Reads an image of kakis.
- Converts the image to the HSV color space.
- Applies a median blur to reduce noise.
- Masks the image to isolate the orange color of the kakis.
- Dilates the mask to ensure kakis are properly highlighted.
- Extracts the kakis from the original image using the mask.
- Finds contours of the masked kakis.
- Estimates the number of kakis based on the most common area obtained from a Gaussian fit of the area histogram.
- Draws contours around the detected kakis and saves the output images.

## Requirements

To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scipy

You can install these libraries using `pip` with the following command:
```
pip install numpy opencv-python scipy
```

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Place your image of kakis in the `./img/` directory and name it `kaki.JPG`.
2. Run the script with the command `python kaki_detection.py`.
3. The script will output two images:
   - `masked_kaki.jpg`: Shows the kakis with the mask applied.
   - `contoured_kaki.jpg`: Displays the original kakis with contours drawn around them.
4. The estimated count of kakis will be printed to the console.

## Files

- `kaki_detection.py`: The main script file.
- `./img/kaki.JPG`: Input image file (you need to provide this).
- `./img/masked_kaki.jpg`: Output image with kakis masked.
- `./img/contoured_kaki.jpg`: Output image with contours drawn around kakis.
